This is my attempt at writing a script that takes a playnice.ly project and exports all the data to a github project using the issues api

this is a work in progress, use at your own risk!

right now it won't work cos the settings file is not in the repo, you can figure out what you need yourself, but you're not gonna get much out of this anyway :)

requires the playnicely python client that can be downloaded from here https://github.com/playnicelyapp/python-playnicely
